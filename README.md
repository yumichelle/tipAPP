Submitted by: Michelle Yu

Time spent: more than 7 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [ ] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.
* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] cancel all x-button in the text field.

## Notes

Felt <a href="http://y2u.be/lyR8w6zmxVc">this video walkthrough</a> was outdated since the current version of Xcode is at 10, so I had to also follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ni_FMKmnhZA">this video walkthrough</a>. Plus when I followed the CodePath walkthrough and ran the simulator, it took too long to run and compile. I was stuck on a white screen for a long time, which is part of the reason why it took me more than 7 hours to finish this project.
I also have trouble submitting the project via Terminal.
